# Decision Tree Model: A Step-by-Step Guide in Python

This project involves building and visualising a Decision Tree model using Python and the "scikit-learn" library. The objective is to classify the Iris dataset, a benchmark dataset in machine learning. The project covers essential steps including data loading and pre-processing, model training, evaluation, and visualisation. By following this project, you will gain a thorough understanding of how to implement and interpret Decision Tree Models for classification tasks using Python.
